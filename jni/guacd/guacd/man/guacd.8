.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guacd
is the Guacamole proxy daemon used by the Guacamole web application and
framework. As JavaScript cannot handle binary protocols (like VNC and remote
desktop) efficiently, a new text-based protocol was developed which would
contain a common superset of the operations needed for efficient remote
desktop access, but would be easy for JavaScript programs to process.
.B guacd
is the proxy which translates between arbitrary protocols and the Guacamole
protocol.

\fB\-b\fR \fIHOST\fR
Changes the host or address that
.B guacd
listens on.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIPORT\fR

.B guacd
listens on (the default is port 4822).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIFILE\fR

.SH SSL/TLS OPTIONS
If libssl was present at the time
.B guacd
was compiled, it will contain SSL/TLS support, and connections between the
web application and
.B guacd
can be encrypted if a certificate file is given.
.TP
\fB-C\fR \fICERTIFICATE FILE\fR
Enables SSL/TLS using the given cerficiate file. Future connections to
this instance of
.B guacd
will require SSL/TLS enabled in the client (the web application). If
this option is not given, communication with guacd must be unencrypted.
.TP
\fB-K\fR \fIKEY FILE\fR
Enables SSL/TLS using the given private key file. Future connections to
this instance of
